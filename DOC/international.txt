People with international Windows won't be able to see correct file names
on disk, because FAT and NTFS partitions require a boot argument,
which specifies I/O charset.

A temporary solution is to use 'iocharset=' boot option each time you boot
the Live distro on a computer with international Windows.

If you're creating a live distribution which will be mostly used on 
computers with international Windows systems, you may need to add iocharset
boot option permanently. In this case, edit:

 - boot/syslinux/syslinux.cfg
 - boot/isolinux/isolinux.cfg
 - boot/dos/config

and add 'iocharset=your_encoding' to the append section.
For example,
  Central european people will use: iocharset=iso8859-2
  Japanese / Korean / Chinese people will use: iocharset=utf8
