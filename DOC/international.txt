People with international Windows won't be able to see correct file names
on disk out of the box, because FAT and NTFS partitions require different
encoding.

There was a boot option iocharset= in the past, which is now completely removed.

Now you simply configure Linux Live scripts to include given locale
(see .config). If you specify only one locale, for example "czech", then
there is no need for any boot parameters.

If you configure linux live scripts to include more than one locale, 
use locale= or lang= or language= boot parameters (all do the same) in order
to specify which one should be used (none is selected as default).

For example, use locale=czech boot parameter to force Czech locales for FAT
and NTFS partitions, Linux Live scripts will use: cs_CZ.ISO-8859-2

If you're creating a live distribution which will be mostly used on 
computers with international Windows systems, you may need to add locale=
boot option permanently. In this case, edit:

 - boot/syslinux/syslinux.cfg
 - boot/isolinux/isolinux.cfg
 - boot/dos/config

and add 'locale=your_language' to the append section,
or 'lang=your_language' or 'language=your_language', all means the same.
