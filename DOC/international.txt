People with international Windows won't be able to see correct file names
on disk out of the box, because FAT and NTFS partitions require different
encoding.

In order to support international NTFS and FAT filesystems, simply configure
Linux Live scripts to include your desired locale (see .config), and use 
a boot parameter like locale=czech (for example) during live system startup.

If you specify only one locale in .config file, for example "czech", then
there is no need for any boot parameters. But if you use "czech,polish" for
example, then linux live scripts can't know which one to use as default, so
the boot parameter locale= is required.

You may use 'locale=' or 'lang=' or 'language=' boot parameters,
all do the same. Sorry for this confusion, but it's better to remember.

For example, if you use locale=czech boot parameter to force Czech locales
for FAT and NTFS partitions, Linux Live scripts will use: cs_CZ.ISO-8859-2

If you're creating a live distribution which will be mostly used on 
computers with international Windows systems, you may need to add the locale=
boot parameter permanently. In this case, edit:

 - boot/syslinux/syslinux.cfg
 - boot/isolinux/isolinux.cfg
 - boot/dos/config

and add 'locale=your_language' to the append section,
or 'lang=your_language' or 'language=your_language', all means the same.
