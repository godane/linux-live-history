I am not any C coder so what is here was just my hack to the httpfs.
In the process I've learned much about how are functions called, how
to allocate memory by malloc() and so on. The code should be entirely
rewritten again, making httpRequest a function which returns a response
structure like { int status, char *headers, char *body }. Also the
socket handling should be rewritten using select() and others, making
the socket in non-blocking mode rather then the current default,
but I don't have any idea how to implement that yet. Don't forget
this is my (almost) first C programming whatsoever :)

Enjoy, and report bugs :)
Feel free to rewrite! :)
