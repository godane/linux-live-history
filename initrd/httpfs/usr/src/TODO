This document should describe what is needed to be implemented next.

*) if a directory is linked several times on a web page, it will show up twice in readdir().
   How to fix that? Perhaps by list.

*) read more than one chunk if chunked transfer encoding is sent by server
   Actually it should reall all chunks, because it will know where is the last one by '\r\n00\r\n' identifier

*) if a virtual document root is set, for example to /pub/, and a file is linked as /mirrors/, it tries
   to get it even if it's outside of our root tree. This should be perhaps fixed.

*) fix http_auth (low priority)
