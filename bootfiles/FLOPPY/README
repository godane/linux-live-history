The file floppy.img.gz contains a compressed image of a floppy
with Smart Boot Manager. Just unpack the .gz archive somewhere
(it will create 1.4MB file) and use rawrite.exe (under Windows)
or dd (under Linux) to create your own boot diskette.

Booting from the diskette will allow you to boot from the CD
even if your BIOS doesn't support it directly.
