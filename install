# Install/Uninstall Linux Live scripts to /usr/bin and /usr/lib
# so the user is able to use all these commands while running his/her 
# Live Linux. This installer is automatically executed by build script.
#
# Why to install Linux Live scripts to your distribution? Well, you don't have to.
# You only have to, if you wish to use linux-live functions while you
# actually run the LiveCD created by these scripts.
