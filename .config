# You shouldn't need to change anything except the first variable:

# Live CD Name. Defaults to 'mylinux'; you should change it to your own
# name if you wish your own branding. Eg. Slax changes it to 'slax'
# Must not contain any spaces
LIVECDNAME="mylinux"
#LIVECDNAME="slax"

# the size of RAMdisk (in KBytes)
# if you change this, then you will need to change the same
# in the following files as well: ./cd-root/boot/isolinux.cfg, ./cd-root/boot/DOS/config
RAM0SIZE=4444

# kernel version. Change it to "2.6.10" for example, if you are building
# LiveCD with a different kernel than the one you are actually running
KERNEL="`uname -r`"

# list of directories which will be modularized
MKMOD="bin etc home lib lib64 opt root usr sbin var"

# compressed directories (cd tree and *.lzm) will be stored here
# (the whole folder will be erased now!)
CDDATA=/tmp/live_data_$$

# change this variable if you installed your distro to some directory.
# for example ROOT=/tmp/newdir. You may leave it empty, then it defaults to /
ROOT=

# Directory with kernel .ko modules, can be different in some distros
LMK="lib/modules/$KERNEL"

# Debug log file for linux-live scripts (during livecd creation)
DEBUG=/tmp/linux-live-debug.log
