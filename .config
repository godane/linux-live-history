# If the writable branch (used for changes) doesn't support symlinks or if it

# filesystem (posixovl).
# This is generally a good idea if you wish to use 'changes=/directory' while

# Use NTFS-3g to provide NTFS-write support in initrd, instead of standard
# read-only NTFS driver from kernel, so it can mount NTFS partitions and 
# save changes to it (eg. using changes= boot param).
# Precompiled NTFS-3G binaries are included in Linux Live scripts.
# If a ntfs partition is mounted this way in initrd, make sure to fix your
# distribution to NOT KILL the ntfsmount process during shutdown procedures.
# Else it will hang the system during shutdown.

# Add locales for given language, separated by space. For supported languages
# see ./initrd/rootfs/usr/share/locale/locale.alias in your distribution.
# This is needed eg. for international NTFS-3g support. If you add more than

# If only one locale is specified, you don't have to specify boot parameter.
