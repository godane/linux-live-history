  To be able to create a Linux Live CD
  you will need to meet all the following requirements:

    * all the following things must be compiled directly into kernel:
      -  devfs (CONFIG_DEVFS_FS=y)
      -  ext2 (CONGIG_EXT2_FS=y)
      -  iso filesystem (CONFIG_ISO9660_FS=y)
      -   with transparent decompression (CONFIG_ZISOFS=y)

    * ovlfs module has to be compiled for the kernel you are using.
      Get the source at http://ovlfs.sourceforge.net, and be sure
      that symlink /lib/modules/2.4.xx/build points to the correct
      kernel source tree before compiling. Install ovlfs to your system.
      Or, download precompiled kernel with ovlfs from http://www.linux-live.org

    * mkzftree is used for img compression. Make sure you have it,
      and also make sure your mkisofs is patched properly.
      (This all is already done in Slackware's cdrtools package)

  These requirements could change with new kernel or ovlfs versions.
