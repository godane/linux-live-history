  To be able to create a Linux Live CD
  you will need to meet all the following requirements:

    * devfs enabled kernel (compile dev filesystem).
      I know it's obsolete but there is nothing working enough now
      so I've decided to use it.

    * ovlfs module has to be compiled for the kernel you are using.
      Get the source at http://ovlfs.sourceforge.net, and be sure
      that symlink /lib/modules/2.4.xx/build points to the correct
      kernel source tree before compiling. Install ovlfs to your system.

    * mkzftree is used for img compression. Make sure you have it,
      and also make sure your mkisofs is patched properly.
      (This all is already done in Slackware's cdrtools package)

    * ext2 filesystem must be compiled into kernel, a module is not enough
      (because initrd is ext2 formated)

  These requirements could change with new kernel or ovlfs versions.
