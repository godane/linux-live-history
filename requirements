  To be able to create a Linux Live CD
  you will need to meet all the following requirements:


    * devfs enabled kernel (compile dev filesystem).
      I know it's obsolete but there is nothing stable enough now.

    * ovlfs modules has to be compiled for the kernel you are using.
      Get the source at http://ovlfs.sourceforge.net, and be sure
      that symlink /lib/modules/2.x.x/build points to the correct
      kernel source tree before compiling. Install ovlfs to your system.

    * mkzftree is used for img compression. Make sure you have it,
      and also make sure your mkisofs is patched properly.
      (This is already done under Slackware)

  These requirements could change with new kernel versions.
