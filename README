 Linux Live scripts

   These scripts are used to create Slax Live CD. It may be used to make
   a bootable CD from your real Linux distribution as well. Just install
   your distro somewhere, unpack these scripts somewhere in $DISTRO/tmp,
   login as root, make changes to .config file and finally run ./build

   The most important is the LIVECDNAME variable in .config file, please
   change it from 'slax' to your own name.

   ./build script will create /tmp/slax.iso (or whatever the name you choosed)
   Burn it and boot it.
