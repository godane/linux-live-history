 Linux Live scripts

   These scripts are used to create LiveCD iso image
   from your real Linux distribution. Just unpack these scripts somewhere
   in /tmp, login as root and run runme.sh. It will produce /tmp/livecd.iso.

   Burn it and boot it.


 Some documentation:

   cat ./info/changelog
   cat ./info/requirements
   vi ./config
