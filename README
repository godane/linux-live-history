 Linux Live scripts

   These scripts are used to create LiveCD iso image from your real
   Linux distribution. Just install your distro somewhere, unpack these
   scripts somewhere in $DISTRO/tmp, login as root and run  runme.sh. It
   will produce /tmp/livecd.iso

   Burn it and boot it.

   cat ./info/changelog.txt
