 Linux Live scripts

   These scripts are used to create Slax Live CD. It may be used to make
   a bootable CD from your real Linux distribution as well. Just install
   your distro somewhere, unpack these scripts somewhere in $DISTRO/tmp,
   login as root, make changes to .config file and finally run ./build

   You'll be asked for the name of your LiveCD during the build process.
