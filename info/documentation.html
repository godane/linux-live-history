<h2>Definitions</h2>

<p><a href=http://unionfs.filesystems.org>Unionfs</a>, developed at Stony Brook university in 2004, is a stackable unification file system, which can merge the contents of several directories (so called branches) while 
keeping their physical content separate. It allows any mix of read-only and read-write branches, as well as insertion and deletion of branches on the fly. Unionfs can be used in 
several ways, for example to unify home directories from multiple filesystems on different disk partitions, or to merge several CDs to create a unified view of a photo archive. In 
a similar view, Unionfs, with copy-on-write functionality, can be used to merge read-only and read-write filesystems together and to virtually allow modification of read-only 
filesystems saving changes to the writable ones.</p>
<p><a href=http://slax.linux-live.org/>SLAX</a>, developed by Tomas Matejicek, is a 180 MB Linux Live distribution which aims at compacting full featured Linux operating system to a portable medium (like mini-CD) and allows everyone to 
boot Linux on any machine without the need to install it. It works even on computers with no harddisk at all. Unionfs is the most important part 
of a SLAX, it allows SLAX to seem and act as a real Linux OS with full-writable root directory tree. So let's speak about unionfs first.</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>To get unionfs working, you need to create a Linux kernel module by compiling its source codes. Unionfs is available as a module extension for Linux Kernel 2.4.20 / 2.6.9 and 
higher. Download the latest version from FTP and extract the content of the archive by using</p>
<pre>$ tar -xzf unionfs-x-y-z.tar.gz</pre>
<p>Then cd to its directory and read README and INSTALL files which are part of the archive. There are many instructions how to avoid problems. Before the compilation itself, you 
might find it useful to know that it's possible to disable compiling debug information together with the module. Debug info is useful for reporting bugs, but significantly 
increases the size of kernel module. 
Two steps are required to disable debug at all:</p>
<ul>
	<li>edit Makefile, and empty the variable UNIONFS_DEBUG_CFLAG (remove &quot;-g&quot; from the end of line)</li>
	<li>create a file called fistdev.mk in the directory with sources, and add this text to it: <br>

	EXTRACFLAGS=-DNODEBUG</li>
</ul>
<p>The compiled kernel module will be about 200 KB big without debug info, compared to 5 MB with it.</p>
<p>Another important thing is to download and extract sources for your running kernel (compilation won't work without them) and then modify LINUXSRC variable in Makefile, adding 
path where you actually extracted it (this can be autodetected in some cases).</p>
<p>Finally, use the following commands to build and install unionfs module into /lib/modules/$(KernelVersion)/kernel/fs/unionfs:</p>
<pre>$ make
$ make install
$ depmod -a</pre>
<h2>Using unionfs</h2>
<p>In the following example, we will merge contents of two directories into a single directory /mnt/union. We assume that all directories already exist.</p>
<pre>$ modprobe unionfs
$ mount -t unionfs -o dirs=/mnt/cdrom1=ro:/mnt/cdrom2=ro unionfs /mnt/union</pre>

<p>From now, the directory /mnt/union will contain all files and directories from /mnt/cdrom1 and /mnt/cdrom2, merged together and both read only. If the same filename is used in 
both cdrom directories, the one from cdrom1 has precedence (because it was specified leftmost in the list).</p>
<h2>Using unionctl</h2>
<p>Unionctl is a tool which is created (together with uniondbg) during unionfs compilation and is installed to /usr/local/sbin. Unionctl is intended to manage the existing union, to list, add, modify or delete existing branches. 
Some simple example follows, use unionctl command without any argument to see all available options.</p>
<p>To list branches in existing union, use</p>
<pre>$ unionctl /mnt/union --list</pre>
<p>which will produce the following output</p>
<pre>     /mnt/cdrom1 (r-)
     /mnt/cdrom2 (r-)</pre>
<p>To add another directory (/mnt/cdrom3) into existing union, use</p>

<pre>$ unionctl /mnt/union --add --after /mnt/cdrom2 --mode ro /mnt/cdrom3</pre>
<p>and unionctl --list will now produce</p>
<pre>     /mnt/cdrom1 (r-)
     /mnt/cdrom2 (r-)
     /mnt/cdrom3 (r-)</pre>
<p>In the case when you change the content of branches themselves, execute the following command to force revalidation of the union:</p>
<pre>uniondbf -g /mnt/union</pre>
<h2>Writing to union</h2>
<p>Merging read-only directories is useful in many cases, but the union itself remains read-only too, until a read-write branch is added to it. In 
that case, all changes are stored in leftmost branch (using copy-up method, see below) and file deletions are done by using one of the three methods available:</p>
<ul>
	<li>

	<p>WHITEOUT mode, inserts a .wh (whiteout) file to mask out a real file</li>
	<li>
	<p>DELETE_ALL mode, tries to delete all instances of a file from all branches</li>
	<li>
	<p>DELETE_FIRST, only deletes the first instance (possibly exposing instances below)</li>
</ul>
<p>WHITEOUT mode is used as default. Copy-up is a special method used to handle file modifications in union. A file from ro branch can't be modified, so it is copied to upper (left) 
read-write branch at the time when the modification should begin. Then the modification is possible and modified file remains in rw branch.<br>
<br>

To add a rw branch at the top of union in our example, type</p>
<pre>$ unionctl /mnt/union --add --before /mnt/cdrom1 --mode rw /mnt/changes</pre>
<p>All the changes will be stored in /mnt/changes and the union will look like this:</p>
<pre>   /mnt/changes (rw)
   /mnt/cdrom1 (r-)
   /mnt/cdrom2 (r-)
   /mnt/cdrom3 (r-)</pre>
<h2>Practical unionfs application - SLAX</h2>
<p>Data stored on a read-only medium like CD-ROM can't be modified. A Live CD Linux distribution, which is offering full write support to all directories, needs to use special 
techniques to allow virtual modifications and to save all changes in memory. SLAX is using these techniques for very long time, starting at the end of 2003 with ovlfs and 
implementing unionfs at the end of 2004. SLAX 5, released in April 2005, can give you an impression of what miracles could be, thanks to unionfs, created.</p>
<h2>SLAX internals</h2>
<p>You need three essential things to boot Linux: Kernel image (which represents the operating system itself), partition or image with root filesystem (which contains initial 
program) and some Linux loader (which reads Kernel into memory and executes it). SLAX CD is booting by using isolinux.bin loader, it contains driver for filesystem on the CD and 
thus is able to read Linux Kernel (file vmlinuz) and root filesystem image (file initrd.gz) from CD to the memory.</p>

<p>When loaded in memory and executed, Linux kernel creates a virtual disk (called Initial ramdisk) in computer's RAM, extracts initrd.gz to it and mounts it as a root filesystem. 
Initial ramdisk used in SLAX is only 4.4 MB big and contains only basic software and drivers needed to handle SLAX startup. The most difficult part follows, so read carefully.</p>
<p>File /linuxrc (found in ramdisk) is executed by Linux Kernel as an initial program. Linuxrc's job is pretty tricky.&nbsp; It creates an empty union in /union directory, it 
mounts tmpfs to /memory directory, and then it locates SLAX CD by mounting all CDs and disks and by searching for a file livecd.sgn. You may be surprised, but the cdrom is mounted 
in /union/mnt/! After that, all necessary images (*.mo) from 
SLAX CD are mounted to directories /memory/images/*.mo and all these mountpoints are, by using unionctl, added to union as an individual read-only branches. Union is then extended by a special 
directory /memory/changes in read-write mode.</p>

              |          +--- kde.mo --------------+
              +---- /mnt/live</pre>
<p>When all modules are added to union and one rw branch is at the top of it, pivot_root is executed. That is pretty tricky too, original root is moved to /mnt/live and /union becomes new root. 
You may explore /mnt/live while running SLAX to see original content of ramdisk.</p>
<p>Finally linuxrc executes /sbin/init which will start all system services and display login screen as usual.</p>
