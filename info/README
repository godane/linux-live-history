This is a live (bootable) CD with Linux OS based on Slackware distribution,
created by using linux-live scripts. See http://www.linux-live.org

Insert this CD to your CDROM drive and reboot your computer.
Make sure that cdrom booting is enabled in your bios.
Voila, you are running Linux now! ;)

You can also run it from DOS (in the case your bios cannot boot from CD),
just start X:\tools\dos\linux.bat from the DOS prompt.
