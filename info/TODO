The future of Linux Live scripts will look like this:

- some kernel requirements (devfs for example) will
  dissappear. /dev tree will be maintained by sysfs and udev,
  devfsd daemon won't be necessary.

  One will be able to use ANY (reasonable) 2.6 kernel configuration

  And this also means that I will be able to use Slackware's official
  (precompiled) 2.6 kernels, which will save alot of work and brings
  better compatibility for .ko modules (the official Slackware kernel
  configuration is well known). People won't need to compile own kernel
  or to install my precompiled version to their LiveCD.

- unionfs filesystem (www.filesystems.org) will be used to overmount CD
  and to insert modules instead of ovlfs, which seems to be not developed
  for many years. Unionfs will also allow me to remove already-inserted
  modules, it will provide the functionality to create the whole LiveCD
  more flexible. SLAX's base filesystem (/base/) will be separable
  to many different modules.
