IMGs (aka modules) are created this way:

At first, the directory (for example /bin) is inserted into iso image,
eg. /tmp/bin.img. Then this small iso image is compressed by using
`mkzftree -F` and finaly it's inserted in the big LiveCD ISO image.

LiveCD ISO image is created with `mkisofs -z` to enable decompressing on the fly.

AFAIK Only Linux supports this "on-the-fly decompressing", so it's not possible
to copy files from the CD to your harddisk in other operating systems then Linux.
