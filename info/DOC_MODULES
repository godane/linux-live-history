How to create own modules for your LiveCD
-----------------------------------------

To create a module for your LiveCD, make an empty
directory somewhere, for example in /tmp/newmod.

The directory /tmp/newmod will contain the whole filesystem
(all changed or new files and directories). For example 
if you wish to include /bin/bash in your module, place it in
/tmp/newmod/bin/bash.

The content of /tmp/newmod directory can be created from
slackware's TGZ package by using "installpkg -root /tmp/newmod packagename.tgz"

Finaly, create the final IMG module from prepared directory tree by using
dir2img /tmp/newmod/ /tmp/modulename.img
The first argument is the module directory
The second argument is the new name for your module


Module insertion works this way
-------------------------------

At first, module is mounted in /mnt/livecd/modulename
and preinsert file is started - only in the case it's
marked as executable, so be sure to chmod it correctly
(for example by using chmod a+x preinsert).

Then, the whole filesystem from ./data is inserted in
the Live filesystem. For example ./data/bin/bash will become
/bin/bash, etc. This insertion is done by using symlinks
(for new files) and by mount calls with "--rbind" option
(for new directories).

Finaly, postinsert file is started (if marked as executable)
to perform some post-insertion operations.

What is ./manual file for? Normally, the module is inserted
at the boot phase, so all your modified or new rc-scripts
are started by your distribution automatically. The problem
is with including the module by using moduse script.
./manual is executed only in the case if the module is included
by moduse tool, so it should contain all commands neccessary
to start appropriate rc-scripts automatically.
