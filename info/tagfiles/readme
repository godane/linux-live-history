These directories describes which packages did I install to gain base LiveCD iso.
You can use them to install the same packages like I did.

How does it work? Copy all these directories to a floppy. Then, boot Slackware install CD1.
Mount your floppy somewhere and run setup, for example by using

   mkdir /floppy
   mount /dev/fd0 /floppy
   setup

Then go through the installation until a message about SELECTING PROMPTING MODE appears
(possibilities: full, newbie, menu, expert, custom, tagpath, help)

Select "tagpath" and type /floppy/tagfiles.base for base packages,
or /floppy/tagfiles.200 for all packages to make 200MB CD.
That's all, good luck.
