 4.0.2
 
  * scripts from /tools look for liblinuxlive functions in two directories now, ./ and /usr/lib


 4.0.1
 
  * fixed copying symlinks to initrd (copy link's target too w/ absolute pathname)
  * created own tempfile function
  * updated error message for mkzftree
  * removed nocopy2ram boot parameter. copy2ram parameter now implifies copy2ram=all
    so it's not possible (it didn't make any sense) to copy/not-copy individual modules
  * All SCSI modules are copied to initrd. This shoudl allow SLAX to boot
    from a cdrom drive connected to SCSI interface! I don't know if the kernel
    can insert apropriate module automatically (without hotplug for example)
    but I believe that it should. If there is someone who could test it,
    let me know please.


 3.0.28

  * Floppy automounting disabled (it caused alot of problems on some hw)
  * Floppy is automounted only with "floppy" boot parameter
  * USB modules for linuxrc are loaded only with "usbdisk" boot parameter
  * Fixed -a (AND) in linuxrc (there was && instead of -a which caused to
    fail loading USB modules at all)
  * Added script to copy&install SLAX to USB Mastorage device (flashdisk)!
    (./bootfiles/create_bootflashdisk.sh, untested but should work)

 3.0.27

  * USB support added back, it's possible to start slax from USB mastorage device
    (only if you know how to boot from it, or by using floppy)
  * added nousb kernel boot parameter again
  * added tools/modinsert.sh script (to insert downloaded modules to LiveCD ISO)


 3.0.26

   mkciso: mkzftree seems unable to compress files >2GB, added a check
   runme.sh: added a check for directories existence (eg. /opt doesn't need to be there)
   accidentaly removed ide-scsi modloading, cd burning doesn't work
   

 3.0.25
 
   fixed mouse autoconfig, it should finaly work now!
   filesystem modules for ext3 and reiserfs added to initrd
   partitions are mounted "ro" in linuxrc, but "default" entry is writed to fstab
   added "lang=" kernel parameter to insert all modules from language cpecific directory cd/lang/$1/*
   fixed loadlin (dos) parameters
   added floppy automounting
   removed usb kernel modules from initrd
   isolinux timeout changed to 2 seconds


 3.0.24

   fixed nohotplug kernel parameter to disable usb modules probing
   fixed img modules with filenames with a dot at the begining in some name
   added passwd=ask kernel parameter to change root password during the boot
   added eject kernel parameter to eject the CD if possible (when copy2ram=all)
   added nolock kernel parameter to disable CD locking
   added devfs and ovlfs checking, print useful error messages if error
   added touch /{etc,root,tmp,var/run}/something to avoid overmounting by ovlfs
   /var is packed by tar+gz like root or etc.
   mouse autodetecting (create /dev/mouse)
   changed module format. It's ISO->COMPRESS->ISO2 now, needs 2 loops to mount
   the final ISO is _not_ compressed. Allows to copy files from CD to RAM / FAT
   debug parameter without =bash will cat /proc/mounts and /proc/self/environ


 3.0.23

   the whole phylosophy completely changed, the LiveCD is modularized now
   cramfs replaced by transparent iso decompression
   autoexec script removed
   added tgz2img.sh script to convert .tgz files into .img
   added dir2img.sh script to convert directory tree into .img
   added img2dir.sh script to convert all back


 2.9.0.22

   changelog for all older versions is lost :(
