  To be able to create a Linux Live CD
  you will need to meet all the following requirements:

   * all the following things must be compiled directly into kernel:
     - devfs (CONFIG_DEVFS_FS=y)
     - ext2 (CONGIG_EXT2_FS=y)
     - tmpfs (CONFIG_TMPFS=y)
     - loop device (CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP=y)
     - ramdisk (CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM=y)
     - initrd (CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD=y)
     - iso filesystem (CONFIG_ISO9660_FS=y)
     -  with transparent decompression (CONFIG_ZISOFS=y)

   * ovlfs module must be compiled for the kernel you are using.
     Get the source at http://ovlfs.sourceforge.net, and be sure
     that symlink /lib/modules/2.4.xx/build points to the correct
     kernel source tree before compiling. Compiling could produce
     some error messages, just ignore them. Install ovlfs to your system.

     Or, download precompiled kernel with ovlfs from http://www.linux-live.org

   * mkzftree is used for img compression. Make sure you have it,
     and also make sure your mkisofs works properly with -z option
     (transparent decompression). This all is already done in Slackware's
     cdrtools package.

   * devfsd must be installed and configured in your distribution
     else your LiveCD won't be able to use devfs (can't open initial console error)
     Unfortunately, devfsd package was removed from Slackware 10,
     you can find it in ./devfsd/ directory for now.

   * Don't install udev package else devfsd won't work!
     use "removepkg udev" if you already installed it

  These requirements could change with new kernel or ovlfs versions.
