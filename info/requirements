Linux Live scripts Requirements         by Tomas M.   http://www.linux-live.org

  To be able to create a Linux Live CD, your kernel must meet all the
  following requirements:

   * all the following things must be compiled directly into kernel:
     - ext2 (CONGIG_EXT2_FS=y)
     - tmpfs (CONFIG_TMPFS=y)
     - ramdisk (CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM=y)
     - initrd (CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD=y)

     You can use untouched Vanila Linux kernel from Slackware!
     
   * all the following things must be compiled in the kernel or as a 
     kernel modules:
     - loop
     - isofs (if you will boot your live distro from CDROM)
     - ehci-hcd, ohci-hcd, uhci-hcd, usb-storage (if you will boot your live distro from USB)

   * all these modules must be available:
     - unionfs.ko (http://www.filesystems.org/project-unionfs.html)
     - squashfs.ko (http://squashfs.sourceforge.net)
     You will need mksquashfs command either, it's a part of squashfs tools.

   * Your distro must be running kernel 2.6.9 or higher
     and udev must be installed and working.
     
   * You must modify your distro so it won't test the status of root directory
     (whether it is or is not writable). For example, Slackware is testing 
     the status of the root partition during boot and if it's read-write, 
     it will display a message and will wait for user input. This is something 
     we don't like, right? Unionfs can't be remounted ro, so I can't avoid 
     this in linux live scripts. I have to patch Slackware rc scripts (rc.S)
     to skip this test. You will need to do something similar for your distro.

   * Your distro must have /usr/bin/chroot

  These requirements could change with new kernel or unionfs versions.
