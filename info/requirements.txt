Linux Live scripts Requirements         by Tomas M.   http://www.linux-live.org

  To be able to create a Linux Live CD, your kernel must meet all the
  requirements noted below. Sample kernel config file can be found in
  ./initrd/kernel-modules/*/.config

  If you don't wish to compile anything, go to www.linux-live.org
  and download precompiled Linux kernel with everything included.

  * Your distro must use kernel 2.6.9 or higher and udev must be installed 
    and working (because devices from /dev are not copied to LiveCD)

  * all the following things must be compiled directly into kernel:
     (these options are usually compiled so you shouldn't have problems)
     - ext2 (CONGIG_EXT2_FS=y)
     - tmpfs (CONFIG_TMPFS=y)
     - ramdisk (CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM=y)
     - initrd (CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD=y)
 
    You can use untouched Vanila Linux kernel 2.6 from Slackware!
    (but in that case you have to compile unionfs and squashfs modules yourself)

  * all the following things must be compiled in the kernel or must be
     available as a kernel modules (.ko):
     - loop (else mount -o loop won't work)
     - zlib_inflate (used by squashfs module)
     - isofs (if you will boot your live distro from CDROM)
     - ehci-hcd, ohci-hcd, uhci-hcd, usb-storage (if you will boot your live distro from USB)

  * all these modules must be available:
     - unionfs.ko (http://www.filesystems.org/project-unionfs.html)
     - squashfs.ko (http://squashfs.sourceforge.net)

     If you compile them yourself, mkdir ./initrd/kernel-modules/2.6.x/
     and copy squashfs.ko and unionfs.ko to it. Then run runme.sh

     mksquashfs command is in ./tools and is dinamicaly linked with glibc.

     In general, you don't need to compile anything unless you wish to use 
     some own kernel configuration, or you wish to use newer version of
     squashfs or unionfs.

  * Your distro must have /usr/bin/chroot or /usr/sbin/chroot

  * You must modify your distro to not test the status of root directory
     (whether it is (is not) writable). For example, Slackware is testing 
     the status of the root partition during boot and if it's read-write,
     it will display a message and will wait for user input. This is something 
     we don't like, right? Unionfs can't be remounted ro, so I can't avoid 
     this in linux live scripts. I have to patch Slackware rc scripts (rc.S)
     to skip the test. You will need to do something similar for your distro.

  These requirements could change with new kernel or unionfs versions.
