Linux Live Scripts TODO list
============================

- If a device has been probed in find_filepath, don't probe it anymore again 
  for the same search name. OR, if the device has been probed but can't
  be mounted (NTFS-3g), try more devices (it seems it doesn't).
  
- nohotplug should affect USB modules probing 

- lilo boot loading
