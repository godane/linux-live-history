Linux Live Scripts TODO list
============================

- bootinst.sh/.bat, bootlilo - make the 'Slax' string customizable, and modify
  it the same way like liblinuxlive

- copy2ram together with changes=slax .. can confuse people and/or make
  troubles if user unplugs the flash key after copy2ram. Perhaps
  ignore 'changes=...' if copy2ram is used?

- when busybox is called to list its applets, it should link to correct libraries
  (from linux live scripts, not from current distro).
