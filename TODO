Linux Live Scripts TODO list
============================

-(k)uselivemod: make sure to free the loop device as well as there is
 no way to free them in clenaup. Or perhaps there is, ls -1 /sys/block/loop* ?
 that would need to mount sysfs in cleanup (or don't unmount it in linuxrc)

- fstab-update - include correct filesystem for / ... it is forcing tmpfs
  now, which is very confusing. This may be problematic because fsck in the
  distro will try to 'check' the filesystem, while it may be aufs in any
  particular time.

- bootinst.sh/.bat, bootlilo - make the 'Slax' string customizable, and modify
  it the same way like liblinuxlive

- copy2ram together with changes=slax .. can confuse people and/or make
  troubles if user unplugs the flash key after copy2ram
