Linux Live Scripts TODO list
============================

- If a device has been probed in find_filepath, don't probe it anymore again 
  for the same search name. OR, if the device has been probed but can't
  be mounted (NTFS-3g), try more devices (it seems it doesn't).
  
- nohotplug should affect USB modules probing 

- lilo boot loading

- chopt = eie ... we need something better, because eie (expand if empty)
  may take a long long time (because fat doesn't support sparse files). We need:
  a) a progress bar, or 
  b) limit the maximum size (maybe using another chopt variable, or eie:64
  syntax for example). Progress bar would be perhaps better, so the user
  can see that something is happening. But is it a good idea to fill the
  device up? Is fat filesystem safe when filled? Maybe eie:17 would be the best
